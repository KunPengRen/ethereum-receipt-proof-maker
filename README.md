### :point_right: Usage:

__>__ To generate a proof for a given transaction hash, first you'll need RPC access to an ETH node on the network your transaction exists on. Once you have that, set it as an environment variable and run the tool thusly::

__`❍ ENDPOINT=<ETH-mainnet-rpc-endpoint> rusty-receipt-proof-maker <your-tx-hash-here>`__


```

ENDPOINT=<redacted> rusty-receipt-proof-maker 0x5d761b001c4d69bf14c94b8e8a604d97e008a8a7dfb74a6459823b2178ffc033 -v`

```

By default, the tool's full tracing logs for each run are output to a file in __`./logs/<utc-timestamp>.log`__

__>__ For usage notes, run the tool thusly:

__`❍ rusty-receipt-proof-maker --help`__

### :nut_and_bolt: Setup:

The tool requires access to a full ethereum node on whichever network you wish to generate receipt proofs for.

You can configure an endpoint for that node by creating a __`.env`__ file in the root of the repo thusly:

```

# At path: ./rusty-receipt-proof-maker/.env

ENDPOINT="<your-endpoint-here>"

```

This allows you to use for example an __[Infura](https://infura.io/)__ endpoint without risking exposing your API key. Another optional endpoint if you are not running your own node is __[Slock.It](http://rpc.slock.it/)__.

If you do not provide an endpoint, the tool will default to __`https://localhost:8545`__, and fail to run at all if it can't connect to a node at that location:

```
rusty-receipt-proof-maker -v 0x5d761b001c4d69bf14c94b8e8a604d97e008a8a7dfb74a6459823b2178ffc033`

✔ Getting RPC endpoint from environment variables...
✔ Endpoint retrieved: http://localhost:8545/
✔ Connecting to node...
✘ HTTP Reqwest Error!
✘ http://localhost:8545/ timed out
✘ Please check your node & port settings and retry.

```

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

### :guardsman: Tests:

To run the tests:

__`❍ cargo test`__

__Note:__ Some expensive tests are ignored by default. To run all test, including those ignored, add the __`--ignored`__ flag.

__:radioactive: CAUTION:__ Some tests rely on access to a full __MAINNET__ node existing at __`http://localhost:8545`__. If one can't be reached at that endpoint, many of the tests will fail.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

### :black_nib: Notes

__❍__ The current memory database usage is pure in that we clone the db and return the new, updated copy back to state. Efficiency sacrificed for immutability. Depending on performance of final tool (whose bottleneck is guaranteed to be the fetching of the potentially many receipts for the transactions in a block from the RPC endpoint) this will be changed.

***

&nbsp;

### :clipboard: To-Do

 - [x] Allow configurable endpoint.
 - [x] Have flag to suppress logging.
 - [x] Have timeout error on reqwests.
 - [x] Have method to convert hex string of even/odd length to offset/non- nibbles.
 - [x] Need a node rlp-decoder!
 - [x] Remove unused fxns
 - [ ] Benchmark it and maybe don't clone the db per above note?
 - [ ] Spinners for when it's doing the bits that take a while...?
 - [ ] Factor out log level stuff into own module (from cli arg parser!)
